In 'Multilayer feedforward networks are universal aproximators', Hornik, Stinchcombe and White proved that multilayer feed forward networks can compute any function at all. This universality theorem is even more striking considering that it also asserts that the approximation can accomplished with single layer intermediate between the input and the output neurons. In this short project we find an instance of this result: we approximate the determinant function.
